#fix vi system-wide to work as you're used to it:
	sudo pluma /etc/vim/vimrc.tiny
	set nocompatible
	set backspace=2

#vi delete multiple lines and selection mode:
  Go to the first line and type d5d (dd deletes one line, d5d deletes 5 lines)
  #~or~
  1. Type Shift-v to enter linewise selection mode,
  2. then move the cursor down using j (or arrows, use h, j, k and l to move left, down, up, right respectively)
  3. type d to delete the selection.

#vi search/replace (http://www.linfo.org/vi/search.html):
  #find
    :s/pattern
  #replace 1:
    :s/pattern/replace/
  #replace 1 per line:
    :%s/pattern/replace
  #replace all in file:
    :%s/pattern/replace/g

#copy line:
  dd #deletes the line
  P #pastes what was deleted

#arrow keys instead of wasd are:
  j = left
  k = down
  l = right
  i = up

#vi default syntax highlighting:
Add to ~/.vimrc:
  syntax on
